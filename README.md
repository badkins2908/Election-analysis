# Election-analysis

## Project Overview
This project was to use python code in order to conduct an election audit by analyzing a small set of election data for three counties in Colorado. The output was to determine the county with the highest turnout in votes and the winning candidate based on total percentage of votes.

This project introduced many aspects of python coding, to include: pulling and analyzing data from a csv file, arrays, dictionaries, for loops, if statements, as well as writing information to a text file. 

Process carried out:
1. Calculate the total number of votes casted.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determin the winner fo the election based on populate vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.6.1, PyCharm, 2021.2.1
- Text File: election_analysis.txt

## Summary
The analysis of the election data shows that:
- There were 369,711 total votes across the three counties (Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe)
- The candidates were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane

- The candidate results were: 
  - Charles received 23.1% of the total votes and 85,213 number of votes.
  - Diana received 73.8% of the total votes and 272,892 number of votes.
  - Raymon received 3.1% of the total votes and 11,606 number of votes.

- The winner of the election was:
  - Diana, who received 73.8% of the total votes.


## Challenge Overview and Summary
The challenge was testing a basic knowledge of coding, all the while showing the power of python. It wasn't too difficult of an analysis and the code wasn't highly complex. 

The output generated from those is as follows:
